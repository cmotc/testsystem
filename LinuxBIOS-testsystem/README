LinuxBIOS testsystem
--------------------

Installation
------------

0. Check out the source tree. If you are reading this document, you might
   have already done so:

     $ svn export svn://coresystems.de/testsystem/LinuxBIOS-testsystem/
     

1. Change the ID code in testsystem.config:

     ID=<YOURID>

   If you don't have an ID yet, please contact info@coresystems.de
   
    

Usage
-----

1. Starting and stopping the testsystem

   The testsystem is enabled with the command 

     $ make start-testsystem

   This adds an appropriate cron job that polls for tests every 
   15 minutes.

   A test log will be written by the name of test-HOSTNAME.log.
   
   To disable the testsystem and therefore delete the crontab of
   the test user, run
   
     $ make stop-testsystem

   NOTE: make stop-testsystem will not kill any currently running
   tests. 

2. Starting tests manually

   $ make runtests

3. Show status

   $ make status

4. Get system into original state

   $ make clean

   (make sure no tests are running)
